<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diego Orellana</h1>
<h2>About me...</h2>
<h3 align="justify">I am a developer passionate about learning about new technologies in the market and implementing them in solutions. I also like to learn from different businesses, support them, and create excellent quality projects, both on the business and technology sides. On the other hand, I have had the experience of leading technology groups, and solving problems with the help of work methodologies, such as SCRUM and Design Thinking. It is worth mentioning that my greatest strength is the Backend side, but I have also participated in Frontend development and regression testing</h3>
